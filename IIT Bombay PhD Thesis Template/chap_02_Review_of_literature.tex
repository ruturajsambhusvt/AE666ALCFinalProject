\section{Introduction}
In this Chapter, the emphasis of the discussion is on retrieval of snowpack parameters using spaceborne polarimetric SAR images. The principle and the imaging geometry of SAR system is described and a brief overview of the polarimetric SAR concepts are presented. A comprehensive exploration of all major factors affecting the SAR signal backscattered by the snow surface is discussed as available in the literature till date.
